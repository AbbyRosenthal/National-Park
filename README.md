## Description
Our National Park Planner allows the impulsive traveler to identify which of the top ranked National Parks they should visit! 

The goal was to create a simple tool to support adventurers in their journey to experience the United Stateâ€™s most incredible locations! Our project allows users to click on one of the top five ranked National Parks and view the upcoming 5 day forecast and address to the visitor center.  The user can then check the box to remember they already searched that destination.  When the page is refreshed, their checkboxes will remain, so they know which parks have already been researched.
